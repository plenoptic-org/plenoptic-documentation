``plenoptic`` is a python library for model-based stimulus synthesis. It
provides tools to help researchers understand their model by synthesizing novel
informative stimuli, which help build intuition for what features the model
ignores and what it is sensitive to. These synthetic images can then be used in
future perceptual or neural experiments for further investigation.

Getting started
---------------

- If you are unfamiliar with stimulus synthesis, see the :ref:`conceptual-intro`
  for an in-depth introduction.
- If you understand the basics of synthesis and want to get started using
  ``plenoptic`` quickly, see the `Quickstart <tutorials/00_quickstart.nblink>`_
  tutorial.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. highlight:: bash

The best way to install ``plenoptic`` is via ``pip``.

$ pip install plenoptic

See the :ref:`install` page for more details, including how to set up an isolated
virtual environment (recommended).

ffmpeg and videos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several methods in this package generate videos. There are several backends
possible for saving the animations to file, see `matplotlib documentation
<https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/animation_api.html#writer-classes>`_ for more
details. In order convert them to HTML5 for viewing (and thus, to view in a
jupyter notebook), you'll need `ffmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/download.html>`_
installed and on your path as well. Depending on your system, this might already
be installed.

To change the backend, run ``matplotlib.rcParams['animation.writer'] = writer``
before calling any of the animate functions. If you try to set that ``rcParam``
with a random string, ``matplotlib`` will tell you the available choices.

Synthesis methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. figure:: images/example_synth.svg
   :figwidth: 100%
   :alt: The four synthesis methods included in plenoptic

- `Metamers <tutorials/06_Metamer.nblink>`_: given a model and a reference image,
  stochastically generate a new image whose model representation is identical to
  that of the reference image. This method investigates what image features the
  model disregards entirely.

  - Example papers: [Portilla2000]_, [Freeman2011]_, [Deza2019]_,
    [Feather2019]_, [Wallis2019]_
- `Eigendistortions <tutorials/02_Eigendistortions.nblink>`_: given a model and a
  reference image, compute the image perturbation that produces the smallest and
  largest changes in the model response space. This method investigates the
  image features the model considers the least and most important.

  - Example papers: [Berardino2017]_
- `Maximal differentiation (MAD) competition
  <tutorials/07_MAD_Competition.nblink>`_: given two metrics that measure distance
  between images and a reference image, generate pairs of images that optimally
  differentiate the models. Specifically, synthesize a pair of images that the
  first model says are equi-distant from the reference while the second model
  says they are maximally/minimally distant from the reference. Then synthesize
  a second pair with the roles of the two models reversed. This method allows
  for efficient comparison of two metrics, highlighting the aspects in which
  their sensitivities differ.

  - Example papers: [Wang2008]_
- `Geodesics <tutorials/05_Geodesics.nblink>`_: given a model and two images,
  synthesize a sequence of images that lie on the shortest ("geodesic") path in
  the model's representation space. This method investigates how a model
  represents motion and what changes to an image it consider reasonable.

  - Example papers: [Henaff2016]_, [Henaff2020]_

Models, Metrics, and Model Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Portilla-Simoncelli texture model, [Portilla2000]_, which measures the
  statistical properties of visual textures, here defined as "repeating visual
  patterns."
- Steerable pyramid, [Simoncelli1995]_, a multi-scale oriented image
  decomposition. The basis are oriented (steerable) filters, localized in space
  and frequency. Among other uses, the steerable pyramid serves as a good
  representation from which to build a primary visual cortex model. See the
  `pyrtools documentation
  <https://pyrtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ for more details on
  image pyramids in general and the steerable pyramid in particular.
- Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), [Wang2004]_, is a perceptual similarity
  metric, returning a number between -1 (totally different) and 1 (identical)
  reflecting how similar two images are. This is based on the images' luminance,
  contrast, and structure, which are computed convolutionally across the images.
- Multiscale Structrual Similarity Index (MS-SSIM), [Wang2003]_, is a perceptual
  similarity metric similar to SSIM, except it operates at multiple scales
  (i.e., spatial frequencies).
- Normalized Laplacian distance, [Laparra2016]_ and [Laparra2017]_, is a
  perceptual distance metric based on transformations associated with the early
  visual system: local luminance subtraction and local contrast gain control, at
  six scales.

Getting help

- `Discussions
  <https://github.com/LabForComputationalVision/plenoptic/discussions>`_ is the
  place to ask usage questions, discuss issues too broad for a single issue, or
  show off what you've made with plenoptic.
- If you've come across a bug, open an `issue
  <https://github.com/LabForComputationalVision/plenoptic/issues>`_.
- If you have an idea for an extension or enhancement, please post in the `ideas
  section
  <https://github.com/LabForComputationalVision/plenoptic/discussions/categories/ideas>`_
  of discussions first. We'll discuss it there and, if we decide to pursue it,
  open an issue to track progress.
